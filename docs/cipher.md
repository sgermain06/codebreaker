How to process a cipher:
- Download the encrypted code.
- Make sure you have enough disk space for it.
- Store to disk.
- Evaluate cipher parallelism and available CPU cores.
- Make sure there is enough RAM available for a block.
- Transfer cipher block from disk to RAM. Hard drive speed and memory speed have an impact here.
- Refer to processing steps.
- If failed, break the loop, notify of failure.
- Transfer deciphered block from RAM to disk. Hard drive speed and memory speed have an impact here.
- Go to step 4 until last block.
- Notify that encrypted code break was successful.
